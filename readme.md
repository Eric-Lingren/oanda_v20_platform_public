# Changes on fork ahead of the upstream remote

* reduced the command line args so now only --bot and --pair are needed    
  ```python main.py --bot "rsi_test" --pair "EUR_USD"```
* stored account number and token as environment variables:
```
bash
export PRACTICE_ACCOUNT=XXX-XXX-XXXXXXXX-XXX
export PRACTICE_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  
```
The tokens etc are then accessed via ```os.getenv('PRACTICE_ACCOUNT')```
* added config.ini file to hold standard args  
* changed the name of setup folder to config so it does not clash with setup.py file
* changed the class inheritance so the kwargs can be passed straight to the bot instance  
* changed the class inheritance so subclasses are no longer called in the parent class
* added import statements to the the strategies ```__init__.py``` to make bot import simpler  
* changed the logging to update a file and report to the console with different levels of information  
  and removed the logging function and added the setup logging script to the start of main.py  
  so its the first code to run   
* added a datestamp to the log filenames   
* added requirements.txt for local environment setup  
* directory structure changed for pytest setup
* added some tests
* added Travis CI and Codecov for build monitoring  
* added setup.py and an .egg file starting to work towards easy deployment as a package    


# Oanda v20 Platform - Public Version - Readme from upstream remote

This is a fully custom forex robot algorithm library built using the python Backtrader framework as reference, with full integration into the Oanda version 20 API schema. I built this platform after dissatisfactory results with other Python/Oanda platforms I was able to find on the market.  Due to this fact, it does not natively support all Oanda API calls you may need for your use case, but it is easily scalable to suit your individual needs.

## General Information:   

This contains sample robots which will evaluate prices, indicators, and execute orders.   

This can be run with a live or demo Oanda account based upon the arguments you pass into the initialization script.   

This is intended to run in a live environment in real time.  If you would like to view my backtesting version optimized to work with historically loaded data in hd5, excel, or pandas data frames with a full Backtrader integration [you can view the repo for that project here. ](https://github.com/Eric-Lingren/bt_oanda)    

You can run this locally or on a deployed linux server.  If you wish to use my server deployment library that works in conjunction with this Oanda platform, [you can view that repo here.](https://github.com/Eric-Lingren/oanda_server_scripts)    

As part of the functionality and high availability intended for trading ecosystems, this platform includes automated email notifications auto sent for each up and down occurrence of the platform.  If you wish to enable this, you will need pass those arguments into your startup script.  This also means you will need to configure a gmail account to use an application password to use for the email sending options if you keep those enabled. There are optional Twilio SMS notifications you can configure as well.

If you would like more information about the Oanda API architecture used within this repo or have more questions on obtaining your Oanda tokens and credentials, you can view the full Oanda v20 developer documentation [here](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/)

## Usage:

To run the platform in terminal on localhost you can start it up with the following script from the root of the project making sure you substitute varibles for your own:   

```python3 main.py --oanda_account <account-number> --oanda_token <oanda-api-token> --pair <currency-pair> --bot <bot-name>```   

The arguments listed above are all required for operation but there are optional ones available also for email and sms notifications.  To view the full list of all arguments the python script will accept, you can check the args.py file contained within the setup folder [here](./setup/args.py)   

Currency pairs passed in must adhere to Oandas v20 schema - capital letters separated by an underscore. I.E. You must use ```EUR_USD``` rather than ```eur_usd``` or ```eurusd``` or ```EURUSD``` or some other variation. If you would like more information on this, you can view the Oanda Instrument developer docs [here.](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/instrument-ep/)     

## Dependencies:

The list of required external 3rd party dependencies is: wheel, twilio, schedule, datetime, requests, json, time, argparse, numpy, tulipy & psutil.    

To install dependencies run:   

```sudo pip3 install wheel twilio schedule datetime requests argparse numpy tulipy psutil```

## Included Robots:

This is a sample repo. As such, everything is fully functional, but this contains no profitable robot algorithms.  You can view the included robot algorithms in the strategies/forex_bots_python folder [here.](https://github.com/Eric-Lingren/oanda_v20_platform_public/tree/master/strategies/forex_bots_python) 

Included is a simple price printer, a basic order execution bot and a simple RSI execution bot.   

Feel free to use this as a platform for your own usage and development of your own robots or contact me if you have ideas of things you would like to see built.   

**None of these bots are profitable! They are for demonstration purposes only. I will not be responsible if you run them on a live account.**
## Tips:

### Indicators:

All indicators are custom built. If you need more than those included, you will need to build your own into the framework.
### Here are some example method calls for reference:
    # print(oanda.Account.get_account())
    # print(oanda.Account.get_account_balance())
    # print(oanda.Account.get_open_positions())
    # print(oanda.Account.get_open_trades())
    # print(oanda.Account.Order.get_orders())
    # print(oanda.Account.Order.get_pending_orders())
    # print(oanda.Account.Order.buy_market(100, 'EUR_USD'))
    # oanda.Account.Order.sell_market(150, 'EUR_USD')
    # print(oanda.Account.get_open_positions())
    # oanda.DataFeed.stream()
### Check All Running Script Processes on a Linux Server:
``` ps -ef | egrep "python|PID" ```   
``` ps -u {user} | egrep "python|PID" ```

### Kill Running Script Processes on a Linux Server: 
``` kill -9 <pid> ```
